Some notes:
1. In order to transform from .md (markdown) to .html, we use the library markdown of Python
However, after transforming, when we insert this content into a .html file:
    {{htmlContent | safe}}
{% comment %} 
By default, when substituting a value in a Django template, Django HTML-escapes 
the value to avoid outputting unintended HTML. If you want to allow for an HTML 
string to be outputted, you can do so with the safe filter
(as by adding |safe after the variable name you’re substituting). 
{% endcomment %}

2. Implement a <textarea> tag in a Django form by using
attribute: widget = forms.Textarea

3. BeautifulSoup is commonly used in Django projects, especially when dealing with HTML content 
manipulation and parsing. While Django itself provides tools for generating HTML templates and
forms, BeautifulSoup offers more advanced capabilities for parsing and manipulating HTML content.
4. https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html: regular expressions in Python
The RE is passed to re.compile() as a string. REs are handled as strings because regular expressions 
aren’t part of the core Python language, and no special syntax was created for expressing them. 
(There are applications that don’t need REs at all, so there’s no need to bloat the language specification
 by including them.) Instead, the re module is simply a C extension module included with Python, just like
  the socket or zlib modules.
